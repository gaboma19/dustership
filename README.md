Dustership is a space western action role-playing game that takes place in the Gaucho Galaxy: where the ruins of long dead galactic empires are now the wild frontier for explorers of the current age.

This is a work in progress. I am building this game in Godot, a free and open-source game engine. My goal with this demo is to build a fun real-time combat system, inspired by games like Hyper Light Drifter and Eastward, that will form the core of the game.

The story starts with April, a retired government officer for the Ammellan administration. She was a member of the Preservers, an elite squadron of intelligence operatives who directly report to the Ammellan emperor. Those days for April are long past, and she now works as a bounty hunter who plies her trade on the outskirts of so-called civilized space.
